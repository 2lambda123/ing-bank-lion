# Storybook Action Logger

A visual element to show action logs in Storybook demos `sb-action-logger`

<Story name="Default">
  {html`
    <style>
      sb-action-logger {
        font-family: 'Nunito Sans', -apple-system, '.SFNSText-Regular', 'San Francisco',
          BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
      }
    </style>
    <div>To log: <code>Hello, World!</code></div>
    <button
      @click=${() => document.getElementById('logger-a53209ghj').log('Hello, World!')}
    >Click this button</button>
    <sb-action-logger id="logger-a53209ghj"></sb-action-logger>
  `}
</Story>

```html
<div>To log: <code>Hello, World!</code></div>
<button
  @click=${() => document.getElementById('logger-a53209ghj').log('Hello, World!')}
>Click this button</button>
<sb-action-logger id="logger-a53209ghj"></sb-action-logger>
```

Note that you need some reference to your logger. Above example shows this by using a unique ID.

## Features:

- A public method `log` to log things to the action logger.
- Overridable `title` property.
- Clear button to clear logs
- A counter to count the total amount of logs

## How to use

### Installation

```bash
npm i sb-action-logger
```

## API

<Props of="sb-action-logger" />

## Variations

### Custom Title

<Story name="Custom Title">
  {html`
    <button
      @click=${() => document.getElementById('logger-vnfoiu3478').log('Hello, World!')}
    >Log</button>
    <sb-action-logger id="logger-vnfoiu3478" .title=${'Hello World'}></sb-action-logger>
  `}
</Story>


## Rationale

This component was created due to a need for a nice visual action logger in Storybook Docs mode.

In docs mode, you do not have access to the action logger addon component, and it is nice to be able to show actions inline in your demos and documentation.

### Opinionated

I added quite a bit of styling on this component to make it look decent.
There are a bunch of styles that you can easily override to make it fit your design system which I believe should be enough in most cases.
If you need more control you can always:

- Override the host styles, there's a few custom CSS props that you can override as well.
- Extend the component and apply your overrides
- Open an issue if you believe it would be good to make something more flexible / configurable

Maybe in the future I will abstract this component to a more generic (ugly) one with no styles, so it's more friendly as a shared component.

### Plugin

If you use an action logger inside your Story in Storybook, you will also see it in your canvas, and this may not be your intention.

One idea I have is that we can simplify the usage further by making this a Storybook (docs-)plugin or decorator or whatever.
I am not too familiar with them at the moment, but it would be cool if someone can simply enable an action logger option on a particular Story inside their .mdx,
and then actions are automatically logged to the visual logger below it. Would need to figure out how to catch the action and pass it to the visual logger element.

I have not investigated yet on the how, but that is the rough idea. Feel free to help out here :)

## Future

I plan on adding more features.
They can always be found in the test folder where I specify new features as tests first, and then I skip them until I implement them. Easy to find them that way.
If the feature you'd like is not in the tests, I probably did not think about it yet or did not plan to do it yet, so in that case feel free to make an issue so we can add it.

I'm happy to accept pull requests for skipped tests (features to be added), see the CONTRIBUTING.md on GitHub for more details on how to contribute to this codebase.
