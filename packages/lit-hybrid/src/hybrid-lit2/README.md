# Hybrid lit2

The tagged template literals inside this package will always require to be rendered inside a
lit2 render function. The goal here is to make these tagged literals accept lit 1 templates,
without having to load lit1 itself.
Depending on the consumer app, these tagged template literals would operate fully with lit2.
