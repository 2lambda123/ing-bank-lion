# Extending lion

The primary unease for lion web components is not to use them directly but to extend them.

They are unstyled so you do not need to fight






# Announcing lion

Bring the web forward - one component at a time.

> Everyone should use web components but not everyone should write them

Hey my name is Alfred and I recently got tasked with enhancing our in-house meeting room reservation app.
I was really proud as it was my solo task under my new boss Diana.
The task at hand was to separate the room summary from the room details.
There was a very detailed design spec but no internal reusable component yet.
After some search I found a popular component that look almost like required -
just some different paddings and a small behavior change.
Options + CSS overrides alone didn't work so I copied it over and did some code adjustments to make it pixel perfect.
My boss was happy, the designers where happy so I was happy.
2 Weeks later we get a security alert as this component had a security issue ðŸ™ˆ
luckily it was already fixed in the latest version ðŸ¤—
So I copy it over and ... ðŸ¤” oh it does not look like the design specs anymore ðŸ˜…
what did I change again the last time? Using a diff I could copy only the relevant code and so I saved the day ðŸ’ª
My boss was ok, the security team and the designers where happy so I was good.
3 Weeks later we get an accessibility warning - the details page is not reachable via keyboard.
Oh that is a tough... according to the a11y gurus the html structure needs to change ðŸ˜…
My component does not allow for it - what to do? find a new component?
I remembered that none of other components would allow for a design like needed (without bigger code adjustments).
As accessibility is mandatory I replaced the tabs with an appropriate version and styled it as good as I could manage.
My boss was unhappy, the designers where unhappy so I was unhappy.
Fortunately the security teams was still happy - they felt my frustration, cheered me up, invited my for drinks and said "It is just one of those days... "

Does this story of Alfred feel somehow relatable?

It highlights multiple issues in modern web development:
- adding a dependency is a big deal
- picking something because of looks along might not always be the best choice
- adjusting behavior/stylings can be tough to maintain
- if something is popular it does not mean it has good accessibility/performance
- UI components are hard


What can we do to tackle these issues?

Imagine having components that purely focus on functionality with no design
Imagine these components come with great accessibility and performance
Imagine these components off great extendability

Now stop imagining and look at lion

### What is lion?

We want to bring the web forward - one component at a time.

To archive this goal lion can be the foundation for your codified in-house Design System.
Aligning on design and usability is already a tough challenge - lets get a jump start on the code.

Lion is the foundation for ing-web which is the codified design system of ING.
It offers distinct systems for common user interface challenges.
