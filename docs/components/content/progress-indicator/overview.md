# Content >> Progress Indicator >> Overview ||10

A web component that implements accessibility requirements for progress indicators.

```html
<lion-progress-indicator></lion-progress-indicator>
```

Note: You don't see a live demo here as it would be empty, since there is no styling. Check out the [examples](./examples.md) if you want to see a possible implementation.
