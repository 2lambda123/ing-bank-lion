export default {

};
```

Lion web components is a set of highly performant, accessible and flexible Web Components.
They provide an unopinionated, white label layer that can be extended to your own layer of components.

CSS Shadow Parts specification defines the `::part()` pseudo-element on shadow hosts, allowing shadow hosts to selectively expose chosen elements from their shadow tree to the outside page for styling purposes. Using part and exportparts attributes elements in a shadow tree may be exported for styling by stylesheets outside the tree.
